    Implement the bisection algorithm.
    Test the program on these functions
    and intervals:
        a) x^(−1) − tan(x) on [0, π/2]
        b) x^(−1) − 2^x on [0, 1]

### NOTE
    There may be some issues using trig functions with the python library that's causing part a to output the wrong root
